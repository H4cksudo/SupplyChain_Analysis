🌟 **Exploring Supply Chain Analytics: A Data-Driven Approach** 🌟  

Excited to share my recent project where I delved into **Supply Chain Analysis** to uncover actionable insights for optimizing operations and improving efficiency.  

🔍 **Project Highlights**:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzed key metrics like revenue, defect rates, and customer demographics.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Developed metrics like cost per unit sold and lead time per SKU for deeper insights.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Leveraged linear regression to forecast revenue and applied K-Means clustering to segment supply chain processes.  
- **Supplier Evaluation**: Benchmarked supplier performance and transportation efficiency using industry standards.  
- **Visualization**: Created intuitive charts and heatmaps to highlight trends in inventory, quality control, and shipping performance.  

🎯 **Key Takeaways**:  
- Skincare products generated the highest revenue, while haircare had the highest defect rates.  
- Kolkata emerged as the leader in product sales, and sea transport proved the most cost-effective mode.  
- There’s room to improve model accuracy and incorporate advanced techniques like ensemble models or deep learning for forecasting.  

📈 This project strengthened my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and supply chain optimization.
